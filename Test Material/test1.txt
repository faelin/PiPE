Let's talk about Example.

In English:


Do: Foo is a local scalar; Bar is a hash. Bat is an array.



{To method_thing: Foo is an array;
Bar does stuff with Fred, Tom gets Jerry, and George and Oranges, Apples, and Grapefruits...

Cat is a scalar that reads and writes to "test.txt".

An array called Nums gets 5, 16, 3E7, and 32e2 and 14, 32, and 12 and 2, 3, and 1.

{An array that gets comparable_fruit (apples, oranges, and pears), snack_fruit (grapes, bananas, and kiwis), and starfruit is called Fruits.}


LABEL_THING does: Bat reads from "test.txt". Yellow is a scalar. Green is a scalar.}
